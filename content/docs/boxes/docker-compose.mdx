# Docker Compose

Boxes define their workloads via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) projects. All features of
standard Docker Compose are supported.

In addition, dboxed adds a new volume type named `dboxed`, which can be used to access attached dboxed volumes. An
example of this can be found in the [volume example](/docs/volumes/example).
