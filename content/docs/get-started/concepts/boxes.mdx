# Boxes

A box is what defines a workload. It also specifies the [network](networks) it is attached to and
the [volumes](volumes) attached to the box.

One or more boxes can be run on a [machine](machines). Boxes can also be moved between machines, without any migration
effort, as dboxed will also move [dboxed volumes](volumes) to the new machine. The same applies to networking when
moving boxes, which is possible due to the P2P nature of dboxed networks.

## Docker Compose

Boxes define their workloads via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) projects. All features of
standard Docker Compose are supported.

In addition, dboxed adds a new volume type named `dboxed`, which can be used to access attached dboxed volumes. An
example of this can be found in the [dboxed guide](../../guide).

## Running a box

A box is run on a [machine](machines), inside a self-contained [sandbox](sandboxes). Follow the mentioned links for details.
