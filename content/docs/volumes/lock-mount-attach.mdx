# Locking, Mounting and Attaching

Dboxed volumes must be locked and mounted before they can be used. These are actions done internally by dboxed, but
it is useful to understand these concepts to make debugging issues easier.

Locking and mounting happen when you run `dboxed volume-mount create <volume-name>`.
Attachments to boxes are performed by the user, either via the CLI or the Web UI.

## Locking

Before a volume can be mounted, it must be locked. Locking prevents that other machines mount the same volume, which
would cause multiple versions of the volume to diverge.
