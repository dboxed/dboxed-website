# Managing Volumes

After creating a volume provider, you can start creating volumes, which you then can mount on any server you like.

## Creating a volume

To create a volume, you can use the CLI:

```shell
dboxed volume create <volume-name> --volume-provider <volume-provider> --fs-size=<size>
```

`<volume-name>` is a name you can choose, it however has to be unique in your workspace. The name can later be used to
refer to the new volume, for example when calling additional CLI commands. `<volume-provider>` is the
volume provider, for example a [rustic provider](/docs/volumes/rustic-provider). The `<size>` as a size in huma readable
form, e.g. `1G` for one gigabyte.
