# Netbird

Dboxed supports [Netbird](https://netbird.io) as provider for P2P VPN based networks.

You can use the Cloud version of Netbird, or use your own [self-hosted](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/installation)
instance.

<Callout type="info">
    Future versions of Dboxed will allow you to use an integrated instance of Netbird, removing the need to provide
    API keys.
</Callout>

Netbird Providers in dboxed can be created via the CLI or via the Web UI.

## Create a Netbird API Token

The first thing you will need to use Netbird networks is to create a service user and access token in Netbird. Please
follow the official Netbird documentation found [here](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/access-netbird-public-api).

## Creating Netbird Network (CLI)

You can create a Netbird network via the dboxed CLI:

```shell
dboxed network create --name <network-name> --type netbird --netbird-access-token=<access-token>
```

Replace `<network-name>` with your desired network name and `<access-token>` with the access token you created before.

After creation, you can verify the existence of the new network via:

```shell
dboxed network ls
```

## Creating Netbird Network (Web UI)

You can also create a network via the Web UI. Simply navigate to the Networks list (via the Sidebar on the left) and
click on `Create Network`.

Enter a unique name for the network, select `Netbird` as network type and fill in the API Access Token. When everthing
is complete, click `Create`.

You will then be able to see the new network in the network list. You can click on `View Details`, which will bring you
to the network details page. The details page allows you to view and edit the network. It also allows you to delete it.

## Using self-hosted Netbird

When using the CLI, you can use the `--netbird-api-url` to specify the API url of your self-hosted Netbird instance.
In the Web UI, the api url can be specified in the creation dialog.
