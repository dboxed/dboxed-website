# Get Started

The easiest way to get started is to use the Dboxed Cloud test instance. Simply sign up and then follow the one of the
quick start guides.

As an alternative, install a [self-hosted](/docs/self-hosting) instance.

<Callout type="info">
    In the future, the Dboxed Cloud test instance will very likely vanish and be replaced with the final Cloud instance.
    This instance will provide a trial period, allowing you to test and play with dboxed before subscribing for a paid plan.
