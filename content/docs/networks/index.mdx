# Networks

Dboxed is fully independent of cloud providers' network capabilities, while still being able to leverage the speed boost
traffic cost savings obtained from private networking.

It achieves this by using P2P VPN solutions, connecting each [box](boxes) directly to all other boxes that it needs
to reach.

For now, only [Netbird](https://netbird.io) is supported. Future versions of dboxed will also support
[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) and/or other P2P VPN solutions.
