# Rustic Provider

[Rustic](https://rustic.cli.rs/) is an incremental backup tool, inspired by [restic](https://restic.net/).

Dboxed can use Rustic as the backbone for volumes. A volume backed by the Rustic Provider is incrementally backed up
periodically. When the volume is released, a final backup is performed, allowing you to restore the volume on another
machine.

## S3 Storage

Rustic needs a S3 bucket for storage of the incremental backups. Please add a S3 bucket first (see [here](/docs/volumes/s3-buckets)).

## Creating a Rustic Provider

To create a rustic provider, you can use the CLI:

```shell
dboxed volume-provider create --name test --s3-bucket=<s3-bucket> --type=rustic --rustic-password="<super-secret-password>"
```

Please replace the S3 bucket name and the rustic password appropriately.

The rustic password is the password used for encryption of the incremental backups.
