# Installation

All components of dboxed are provided via a single executable binary, namely the `dboxed` binary.

The easiest to install the binary is via the provided installation script:

```shell
curl -sSL https://dboxed.io/install.sh | sh
```

In case you don't have curl installed, for example inside a fresh alpine installation, use:

```shell
wget -qO - https://dboxed.io/install.sh | sh
```
