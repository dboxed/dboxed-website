# Self Hosting

Dboxed can be fully self-hosted, with all the features available in [Dboxed Cloud](./dboxed-cloud), but fully in your
control.

<Callout type="warning">
    Dboxed is in a very early stage of development. Using it for production workloads is not advised yet, but feel free to use
    it for personal projects that can tolerate downtimes and even data loss.
