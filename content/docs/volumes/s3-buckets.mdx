# S3 Buckets

Many volume providers use S3 as the underlying storage/backup mechanism. The Rustic Provider, for example, uses it to create periodic
incremental backups.

## Creating a S3 bucket

For now, creating and providing S3 buckets is not in the scope of dboxed. This means, you will have to use an external
S3 provider, like [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or [Hetzner's Object Storage](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/).

Please create a bucket in one of these (or any other compatible S3 provider) first and then setup access credentials
(access key id and secret access key). You'll need these credentials to add the bucket to dboxed.

<Callout type="info">
    Future versions of dboxed will allow you to use an integrated S3 provider, allowing you to reuse your own storage on your own servers.
</Callout>

## Adding a S3 bucket

You can add a bucket via the CLI:

```shell
dboxed s3-bucket add --endpoint https://s3.amazonaws.com --bucket=<bucket-name> --access-key-id=<access-key> --secret-access-key=<access-key-id>
```

Please replace the bucket name and credentials appropriately.

You can also use the Web UI to create a bucket by navigating the `S3 Buckets` page and clicking on `Add Bucket`.
