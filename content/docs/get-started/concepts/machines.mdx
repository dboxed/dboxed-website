# Machines

A machine is a server that is able to run [boxes](boxes). Dboxed tries very hard to keep the requirements for such
servers as low as possible, allowing you to use any kind of server. The only requirements dboxed has on a server is
a recent Linux Kernel, internet and root access.

Here are some examples of server types you may use:
1. [Hetzner Cloud Servers](https://www.hetzner.com/de/cloud/)
2. [Hetzner Dedicated Server](https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/)
3. [AWS Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Instances.html)
4. All other cloud providers that offer VPSs
5. Servers from your own your datacenter
6. Your single Server(rack) in your company office
7. Your Raspbery Pi
8. Inside Docker Containers (including on your Mac, even though it will be slow)

## Networking

Dboxed only requires an outbound internet connection for its basic functionality. It does not require you to have
private networking (e.g. [AWS VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html) or [Hetznet Cloud Network](https://docs.hetzner.com/networking/networks/overview/))
to work, as it uses P2P VPN solutions (like [Netbird](https://netbird.io)) for its private network abstraction.

At the same time, it will leverage such private networks when detected to optimize for speed and reduce traffic costs.

See [networks](networks) for more details.

## Persistence

Dboxed uses [dboxed volumes](volumes) for persistent storage. These volumes do not require support from the
underlying cloud provider (if you're even running on a cloud server) and work on all machine types.

See [volumes](volumes) for more details.

## Machine Providers

<Callout type="info">
    Machine Providers are not fully implemented yet. Stay tuned for updates.
</Callout>

Dboxed allows you to dynamically create machines from the dboxed CLI and the Web UI. This means that you do not have
to provide machines by yourself, but instead can rely on dboxed creating these fully automatically for you.

Currently, AWS and Hetzner are supported. Future versions of dboxed will support many more providers.
