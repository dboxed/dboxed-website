# Docker Compose

Boxes define their workloads via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) projects. All features of
standard Docker Compose are supported.

In addition, dboxed adds a new volume type named `dboxed`, which can be used to access attached dboxed volumes. An
example of this can be found in the [volume example](/docs/volumes/example).

## Creating boxes with a compose project

To create a box with a docker compose project attached to it, pass `--compose-file` to the `dboxed box create` command.

As an example, consider the following compose file:

import DockerComposeFile from '../example-files/docker-compose-simple.mdx';

<DockerComposeFile/>

You can create a box with this compose file attached:

```shell
dboxed box create --name example --compose-file /path/to/docker-compose.yaml
```

The argument `--compose-file` can be specified multiple times, allowing you to add multiple compose projects to the new
box.

### Adding and removing compose projects

You can also add a compose project to an already existing box. If the box is being run on a machine, the sandbox
will start it immediately.

To add the compose file from above to an existing box, run the following command:

```shell
dboxed box add-compose example  --compose-file docker-compose.yaml
```

The argument `--compose-file` can be specified multiple times, allowing you to add multiple compose projects to the
box.

You can also use the Web UI to add a compose project to a box. Simply navigate to the Boxes page, enter the box details
and switch to the `Compose Projects` tab. You can add a project by clicking on `Add Project`.
