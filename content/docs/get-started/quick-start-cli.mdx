# Quick Start (CLI)

Dboxed can be used from the Web UI or from purely from the CLI. This quick start explains how to use it from the CLI.

Please [install](installation) dboxed first, as you will need the dboxed binary to continue.

This guide assumes that you want to use the cloud version of Dboxed. If you want to use a self-hosted instance, follow
the [self hosting](/self-hosting) instructions first.
