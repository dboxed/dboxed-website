# Using Networks

After creating a network, you can use it by attaching them to [Boxes](/docs/boxes).

## Attaching to a new box

Currently, networks can only be attached to newly created boxes. You can achieve this via the CLI:

```shell
dboxed box create --name <box-name> --network <network-name>
```

As an alternative, you can use the Web UI to create a box with an attached network. Simply select the network after
clicking on `Create Box`.

When this box is now started, it can communicate with any other box on the same network, no matter on which machine
or where in the world it runs.
