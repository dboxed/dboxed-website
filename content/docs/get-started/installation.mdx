# Installation

All components of dboxed are provided via a single executable binary, namely the `dboxed` binary.

The easiest way to install the binary is via the provided installation script, which should work on all major distributions
and MacOS. Dboxed will also be added to popular package managers like Homebrew.

### `curl` based

```shell
curl -sSL https://dboxed.io/install.sh | sh
```

### `wget` based
In case you don't have curl installed, for example inside a fresh alpine installation, use:

```shell
wget -qO - https://dboxed.io/install.sh | sh
```
