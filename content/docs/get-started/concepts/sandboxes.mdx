# Sandboxes

A sandbox is the containerized environment that runs on a [machine](machines) and executed the workloads defines by the [box](boxes).

## Technology

Sandboxes are created and run with the help of [libcontainer](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/tree/main/libcontainer),
which is also internally used by [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc), [containerd](https://containerd.io/) and
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run containers.

Due to the nature of libcontainer and [Golang](https://go.dev/), dboxed is able to create and run containers without
any OS level dependencies. This means, that you do not need to pre-install Docker or any other container runtime.

This also means that dboxed does not need to deeply integrate into your OS. It only needs to add itself as an automatically
starting service.

All this ensures that dboxed can run boxes on any Linux machine with a recent Kernel and internet connectivity.

## Content

A sandbox runs a minimalistic Linux distribution based on [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/). It uses a
lightweight init system ([s6](https://skarnet.org/software/s6-linux-init/)) to run Docker and some dboxed services.

## Containers and Namespaces

The sandbox is completely containerized and runs encapsulated from the host system.
