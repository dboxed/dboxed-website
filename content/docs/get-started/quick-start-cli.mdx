# Quick Start (CLI)

Dboxed can be used from the Web UI or from purely from the CLI. This quick start explains how to use it from the CLI.

Please [install](installation) dboxed first, as you will need the dboxed binary to continue.

## Cloud vs. Self Hosted

This guide assumes that you want to use the cloud version of Dboxed. If you want to use a self-hosted instance, follow
the [self hosting](/docs/self-hosting) instructions first.

## Login

You will first need to login to dboxed, simply call the login sub-command:

```shell
dboxed login --api-url=https://api.test.dboxed.io
```

Then follow the instructions printed on the console.

<Callout type="info">
    You might notice the `--api-url` given to the command, which provides the test api URL of the Dboxed Cloud. This will
    later be removed when the production instance of Dboxed Cloud becomes available.
</Callout>

If you want to use your self-hosted Dboxed instance, then you will need to provide the URL to your private instance
instead.

## Create box

A [box](concepts/boxes) is what defines the workloads that you want to run on a machine. A box can be part of
a [dboxed network](concepts/networks), but it doesn't have to. For the simplicity of this guide, we will start
without a network. A box might also have [dboxed volumes](concepts/volumes) attached, which we will also leave
out for now.

The actual workloads inside a box are defined via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) files. First, create
this file:

import DockerComposeFile from '../example-files/docker-compose.mdx';

<DockerComposeFile/>

Now create [box](concepts/boxes) that will later be run on your server. Replace the docker-compose.yaml path appropriately.

```shell
dboxed box create --name quickstart --compose-file /path/to/docker-compose.yaml
```

## Create a box token

To run the box, you will need a token. Create it now:

```shell
dboxed token create quickstart --box=quickstart
```

This command will create and print the secret token. You will need this token in the next section.

## Get a machine

A [machine](concepts/machine) is anything that runs a recent Linux Kernel with a working internet connection.
This means, you could now re-use one of your existing servers (bare-metal, VPC, cloud servers, Raspberry Pi, ...)
or create a server in one of your preferred cloud providers. If you have such a machine, or can provision one, connect
to it via ssh and continue the quick-start guide on it.

For testing purposes, it's also absolutely fine to run a box inside a local Docker container. For this, run:

```shell
docker run --rm -ti --privileged alpine sh
```

Then continue working inside the freshly started shell of this container.

<Callout type="info">
    Future versions of dboxed will allow you to create machines from the CLI and/or from the Web UI. We will support
    all popular cloud/VPS providers, including cheap providers like Hetzner.
</Callout>

## Install dboxed on the machine

The chosen machine will need to have the dboxed binary installed as well.
Follow the [installation](installation) instructions while connected to the machine.

## Run the box

Now it's time to actually run the box on the chosen machine. Execute the following command on the machine, while
replacing the `<box-token>` placeholder with the token you generate before.

```shell
dboxed sandbox run quickstart --api-url=https://api.test.dboxed.io --api-token=<box-token>
```

This will now start a [sandbox](concepts/sandbox) that executes the docker compose workloads. The sandbox
contains everything that is needed to run the workloads, including Docker itself.

## Access the box

The example compose project from above starts three containers. The first one is the `whoami` container, which simply
serves http server that just returns some information about itself when it receives a request. As this runs inside the
sandbox, it is not accessible from the outside world.

To make it reachable, we also have the `localtunnel` container which simply runs [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.me),
allowing you to access the `whoami` container from the outside. To find the URL and password, you need to look into the
logs of the `localtunnel` container.

Run the following command from your computer (not inside the machine where the box runs on).

```shell
dboxed box logs quickstart
```

It will show you a list of log files available, select the `quickstart-localtunnel-1` container log and open the URL
shown in the logs. It should look like `https://random-sub-domain.loca.lt`. Open this URL and type in the password that
is also shown in the log.

## Stopping the box

You can stop the box directly from the machine it runs, or request a shutdown remotely via the api/cli.

To stop it on the machine that runs the box:

```shell
dboxed sandbox stop quickstart
```

Or from your local machine via:

```shell
dboxed box stop quickstart
```

<Callout type="warning">
    Please note that stopping a sandbox does not remove it from the machine. You're still left with the filesystem contents
    of the sandbox. Please read the next chapter for cleanup.
</Callout>


## Cleanup

To remove the box, run:

```shell
dboxed box rm quickstart
```

To remove the sandbox from the machine, run this on the machine:

```shell
dboxed sandbox rm quickstart
```
