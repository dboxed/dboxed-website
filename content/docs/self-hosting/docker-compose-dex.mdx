# Docker Compose with Dex Identity Provider

This guide will show you how-to self-host dboxed with [dex](https://dexidp.io/) as the Identity Provider.

The strength of Dex is its simplicity, allowing you to fully configure it via a config file. It can also be configured
to provide statically configured users, which is good enough for many homelab setups.

## Requirements

You'll need a few things for this guide:

* A publicly reachable server (e.g., a Hetzner cloud server) with ports 80 and 443 open.
* A public DNS entry pointing to the public IP of your server

## Variables

The configuration files in this guide use multiple variables. Create the following file and set appropriate values
for each variable:

import DboxedEnv from './files/dboxed.env.mdx';

<DboxedEnv/>

## Preparing configuration files

Create the following 3 files:

import DexConfig from './files/dex-config.yaml.mdx';
import DockerComposeFile from './files/docker-compose.yaml.mdx';
import DboxedServerConfig from './files/dboxed-config.yaml.mdx';

<DexConfig/>

<DboxedServerConfig/>

<DockerComposeFile/>
